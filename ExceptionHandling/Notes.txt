}
CATCH(EXCEPTIONCLASSNAME:NAME OF REFRENCE VARIABLE NAME e){
    e.printStackTrace
    system.out.println(e.toString())
    
}

Finally Block  = it alsways occur whether exception is handled or not 
Finally
{
    //clean up code 
}

throw


class YoungerAgeException extends Exception{
        YoungerAgeException(String MSG){
            super(MSG);
        }
}
public class ThrowBasic {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int age = 16;

            else{
                System.out.println("Valid");
            }
        }
        catch(YoungerAgeException e){
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
